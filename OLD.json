Join us for a paid Student Researcher position that offers the opportunity to work directly with Google research scientists and developers on research projects.\n\nThe Student Researcher Program offers more opportunities for research students to work on critical research projects at Google in a less structured way. The program allows for opportunities beyond the limitations of our traditional internship program on aspects such as duration, time commitment, and working location (with options for on-site or remote). The topics student researchers work on tend to be open-ended and exploratory, and don't always have a clear deliverable like a traditional internship would.\n\nGoogle Research is building the next generation of intelligent systems for all Google products. To achieve this, we're working on projects that utilize the latest computer science techniques developed by skilled software developers and research scientists.

Students are encouraged to learn about some of the possible projects by visiting the IPP Projects pages for projects collecting data and projects currently under construction.\n\nA good idea of the kinds of possible research projects students may be involved in can be gained from viewing student research papers from previous years.",
    "job_requirements": "The program is open to Canadian Citizens and permanent residents. At the time of application students must be registered in an undergraduate program at a Canadian university, leading to a Bachelor of Science or Engineering degree. They should be within two years of graduation by the beginning of the summer they are applying to spend in the program. They must be majoring in physics, engineering, or computer science. Students who have previously spent a summer at CERN (whether part of this program or not) are not eligible.\n\nSuccessful applicants are expected to also hold either an NSERC USRA or TRIUMF summer student position. Although the program is administered and partially funded by the Institute of Particle Physics, the IPP does not have NSERC USRA positions to award and does not administer the TRIUMF positions. Students are expected to pursue these options by also applying for an NSERC USRA position at a Canadian university or directly to TRIUMF.

At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.\n\nWe've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.\n\nNotion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day). This internship will take place from May - August and you will need to be able to work out of our NY or SF office during this time.\n\nAbout The Role:\n\nMobile devices have reshaped personal computing-the power of a desktop now fits in our pockets.

Take a look at what our past intern cohort worked on with our Blog post here and here and TikTok post.\n\nWhat You'll Achieve:\nWrite clean, secure, tested, and documented code.\nYou'll collaborate with the team to strategize, mold, and develop innovative features for our Android application.\nAt our core, we prioritize crafting top-tier applications.

Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.\n\nWe've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.\n\nNotion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day). This internship will take place from May - August (based on your summer schedule) and you will need to be able to work out of our NY or SF office during this time.\n\nAbout The Role:\n\nMillions of people use Notion - and this number is increasing every day. That means a million people trust us to deliver a fast, reliable, and secure experience, and we value this more than anything. We want to keep earning trust, while also continuing to amaze our users with the tools they can build in Notion. This is where you come in. You will be a part of our first engineering internship class and will help us forge a performant and reliable path forward to Notion's future.\n\nDuring your 12-week internship, you will be paired with a mentor that will help guide you as you work closely with our team to build and ship impactful projects. These projects will drive valuable impact to our customers and engineers. From product engineering, mobile, to infrastructure and security, we have opportunities available on different teams. Take a look at what our past intern cohort worked on with our Blog post here and here and TikTok post.\n\nWhat You'll Achieve:\n\nWrite clean, secure, tested, and documented code.\n\nDesign & enhance the Notion platform with new capabilities, as and when the need arises.\n\nDesign, develop, and own new product functionality and/or infrastructure leveraging modern frameworks and tooling.\n\nDevelop, fix and debug software for web services, databases, applications, tools, networks.\n\nQualifications:\n\nPursuing a bachelor's or master's degree in computer science, engineering, or another related field. Targeting a 2026 full-time start date. Must graduate between December 2025 - August 2026.\n\nPrevious internship experience.\n\nWorking towards a proficiency of one or more programming languages such as Typescript, Node.js, Go, Python, Java, Swift, Rust, or Kotlin.\n\nYou find large challenges exciting and enjoy discovering problems as much as solving them.\n\nYou are able to problem-solve and adapt to changing priorities in a fast-paced, dynamic environment.\n\nThis internship will take place from May - September (based on your summer schedule) and you will need to be able to work out of our NY or SF office during this time.\n\nSkills You'll Need To Bring:\n\nThoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.\n\nFor a backend internship: You have a passion for learning how parts of a system fit together-from the user interface to the data model. Familiarity with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL is a plus.\n\nFor a frontend internship: You have a passion for learning technologies (CSS, Javascript, & React) and best practices in front-end architecture, including performance, accessibility and usability.\n\nPut users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact-good and bad.\n\nNot ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.\n\nEmpathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.\n\nTeam player: For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.\n\nNice to Haves:\n\nYou have expertise with specific technologies that are part of our stack, including Typescript, React, Electron, Node.js, AWS, and Postgres.\n\nYou've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others-and understand why we're big fans of their work.\n\nYou have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.\n\nOur customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger. If you share our values and our enthusiasm for small businesses, you will find a home at Notion.\n\nNotion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.

This position can be performed remotely from anywhere in Canada.]\n\nAbout Quora:\nQuora's mission is to grow and share the world's knowledge. To do so, we have two knowledge sharing products:\n\nQuora: a global knowledge sharing platform with over 400M monthly unique visitors, bringing people together to share insights on various topics and providing a unique platform to learn and connect with others.\nPoe: a platform that lets people ask questions, get instant answers, and have back-and-forth dialogue with various generative AI models (bots). As AI capabilities rapidly advance, Poe provides a single platform to instantly integrate and utilize these new models.\n\nBehind these products are passionate, collaborative, and high-performing global teams. We have a culture rooted in transparency, idea-sharing, and experimentation that allows us to celebrate success and grow together through meaningful work. Join us on this journey to create a positive impact and make a significant change in the world.\n\nAbout the Team and Role:\nA Quora internship is not an ordinary internship. There's no busy work. Every project that our interns work on is important to the company and its goals.\nAs a team, we are dedicated to holding high standards, developing a strong and passionate culture, and emphasizing impact. We value building a culture with strong engineering values and goals because we believe that it is the key to building a great company and product. Interns play an important role in this, as they work alongside full-time employees as equals, working on the same projects that help drive the company and product forward.

The Summerland Research and Development Centre was established in 1914, in the heart of the Okanagan Valley in British Columbia, a semi-arid eco-zone that is Canada's most water challenged and yet most biologically diverse eco-region. This unique setting inspires researchers at the Centre to focus on sustainable crop production practices to help preserve and enhance the resilience of such sensitive environments within and across Canada.\n\nIn this context, the Summerland Research and Development Centre (SuRDC) invites applications for co-op students to contribute to the enhancement of agricultural sustainability and rangeland conservation through research on the biological control of invasive plants and insects. We currently have opportunities for two co-op students to develop their practical ecology and evolution skills in field, dry-lab, and wet-lab settings.\n\nThe biological control laboratory works to understand the ecology, evolution, and natural history of invasive species, as well as the endemic species with which invaders or their control agents interact. We draw on methods from, plant, molecular and evolutionary ecology, entomology, and conservation biology to develop sustainable, biologically-based methods of invasive species control. Our team consists of several students (undergraduate and graduate), post-doctoral researchers, technicians and research scientists.\n\nThe focus of the successful candidate will be to conduct field and lab-based research on the ecological and evolutionary determinants of invasive species success and control. The candidate will develop expertise in plant and insect field ecology and evolution, molecular ecology, and data management and analysis. Together, this work will directly contribute new knowledge of biological control agents of invasive weeds and insects, enhancing agricultural sustainability and rangeland conservation by actively contributing to AAFC's capacity in research on invasive species control. There is the opportunity to develop an independent project related to the biocontrol lab's objectives.",
